In this project, I modeled the Repressilator, a synthetic genetic oscillator, by translating the biological system into a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations. 
I implemented numerical solvers in Python (NumPy, SciPy) to simulate protein and mRNA dynamics, analyzed parameter influences using sensitivity studies, and visualized oscillatory behavior with Matplotlib.
